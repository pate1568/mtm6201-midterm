## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Skillbridge, a test project for an online e-learning platform! Skillbridge is a demonstration of an e-learning platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the client-side. Although it's a test project, it aims to showcase some of the fundamental features you might find in a full-fledged e-learning platform like Udemy.

## Features

### 1. Sample Course Selection

Skillbridge offers a limited selection of sample courses spanning various topics such as programming, design, marketing, and more. These courses are designed to demonstrate the functionality of the platform.

### 2. Basic Learning Experience

Engage with course material through basic features such as viewing course content, navigating lessons, and taking simple quizzes.

### 3. Simulated Instructor Interaction

Experience a simulated interaction with instructors through pre-defined messages and feedback prompts within the course interface.

### 4. Limited Flexibility

While the platform allows for some flexibility in accessing courses and progressing through content, it's important to note that this is a test project with limited functionality compared to a fully developed e-learning platform.

### 5. Simulated Certification

Upon completing a sample course, users can receive a simulated certificate of completion. Please note that these certificates are for demonstration purposes only and do not hold any real value.
